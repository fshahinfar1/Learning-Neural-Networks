# Adaline
This very similar to `perceptron` introduced by Rossenblatt.
The difference is it will use neuron value (the dot product of inputs and weights)
before activation function for training.

# Weird observations
1. It simply doesn't work as it should
2. When using the value after an activation fuction like sigmoid it reaches the goal
3. Normalizing the data did help (even without activation function)
4. Some times using different learning rates help to reach the result
5. I didn't tried decreasing learning rate while training it might be helpful
